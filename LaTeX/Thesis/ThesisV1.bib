@article{Omi2011,
abstract = {The time histogram is a fundamental tool for representing the inhomogeneous density of event occurrences such as neuronal firings. The shape of a histogram critically depends on the size of the bins that partition the time axis. In most neurophysiological studies, however, researchers have arbitrarily selected the bin size when analyzing fluctuations in neuronal activity. A rigorous method for selecting the appropriate bin size was recently derived so that the mean integrated squared error between the time histogram and the unknown underlying rate is minimized (Shimazaki & Shinomoto, 2007 ). This derivation assumes that spikes are independently drawn from a given rate. However, in practice, biological neurons express non-Poissonian features in their firing patterns, such that the spike occurrence depends on the preceding spikes, which inevitably deteriorate the optimization. In this letter, we revise the method for selecting the bin size by considering the possible non-Poissonian features. Improvement in the goodness of fit of the time histogram is assessed and confirmed by numerically simulated non-Poissonian spike trains derived from the given fluctuating rate. For some experimental data, the revised algorithm transforms the shape of the time histogram from the Poissonian optimization method.},

abstract = {We consider a sequence of observations which are collected at arrival times of a renewal process, possibly dependent on the observations themselves. The arrival of claims in insurance or shocks in engineering applications is frequently modelled in this way. The distribution of the maximum of such observations until a given time is well understood in the relatively straightforward case of the renewal process with finite mean interarrival times. The limiting behaviour of the maximum in the infinite mean case is more challenging, but it was characterised under certain assumptions.   In this article, we extend the previously established results in this setting, and show how one can characterise asymptotic behaviour of all upper order statistics in the sequence of observations collected at renewal times. In contrast to the previous studies, we base our analysis in the point processes theory. We study certain well--known types of dependence between observations and interarrival times, relaxing the conditions previously seen in the literature. Finally, we show how our approach yields some new results concerning, for instance, the maximal sojourn time of a continuous time random walk.},

abstract = {We study the dynamic network of e-mail traffic and find that it develops self-organized coherent structures similar to those appearing in many nonlinear dynamic systems. Such structures are uncovered by a general information theoretic approach to dynamic networks based on the analysis of synchronization among trios of users. In the e-mail network, coherent structures arise from temporal correlations when users act in a synchronized manner. These temporally linked structures turn out to be functional, goal-oriented aggregates that must react in real time to changing objectives and challenges (e.g., committees at a university). In contrast, static structures turn out to be related to organizational units (e.g., departments).},

We found that the average number of new infections n(t) at time t decays as a power law in the long-time limit, n(t)$\sim$t^{-$\beta$}, leading to extremely slow prevalence decay. We also found that the exponent in the spreading dynamics $\beta$ is related to that in the waiting time distribution $\alpha$ in a way depending on the interactions between agents but insensitive to the network topology. These observations are well supported by both the theoretical predictions and the long prevalence decay time in real social spreading phenomena. Our results unify individual activity patterns with macroscopic collective dynamics at the network level.},

abstract = {It is important to study the traffic in the wireless network control and management. This paper proposes the use of the EVT (extreme value theory) for the analysis of wireless network traffic. The role of EVT is to allow the development of procedures that are scientifically and statistically rational to estimate the extreme behavior of random processes. We have performed extensive simulation experiments by taking traffic data that is greater than a given threshold value. The results of our experiments and analysis show the wireless network traffic model obtained through the EVT fits well with the empirical distribution of traffic. Meanwhile, we can obtain EVT model has the lowest "average deviation" compared with other popular distribution model such as exponential, lognormal, gamma, Weibull. Thus illustrates EVT is more suitable than other distributions to model the traffic and it has a good application foreground in the analysis of wireless network traffic.},

Various properties of the discrete failure distribution $P_k$ are shown to be reflected in corresponding properties of the continuous life distribution $H(t)$. As an example, if $P_k$ has discrete increasing hazard rate, then $H(t)$ has continuous increasing hazard rate. Properties of $P_k$ are obtained from various physically motivated models, including that in which damage resulting from shocks accumulates until exceedance of a threshold results in failure. We extend our results to continuous wear processes. Applications of interest in renewal theory are obtained. Total positivity theory is used in deriving many of the results.},

abstract = {The mathematical description of diffusion has a long history with many different formulations including phenomenological models based on conservation of mass and constitutive laws; probabilistic models based on random walks and central limit theorems; microscopic stochastic models based on Brownian motion and Langevin equations; and mesoscopic stochastic models based on master equations and Fokker–Planck equations. A fundamental result common to the different approaches is that the mean square displacement of a diffusing particle scales linearly with time. However there have been numerous experimental measurements in which the mean square displacement of diffusing particles scales as a fractional order power law in time. In recent years a great deal of progress has been made in extending the different models for diffusion to incorporate this fractional diffusion. The tools of fractional calculus have proven very useful in these developments, linking together fractional constitutive laws, continuous time random walks, fractional Langevin equations and fractional Brownian motions. These notes provide a tutorial style overview of standard and fractional diffusion processes.},

Several physical consequences are discussed which are relevant to dynamical processes in complex systems. Methods of solution are introduced and for some special cases exact solutions are calculated. This report demonstrates that fractional equations have come of age as a complementary tool in the description of anomalous transport processes.},

abstract = {We prove a law of large numbers and a functional central limit theorem for multivariate Hawkes processes observed over a time in- terval [0,T] in the limit T → ∞. We further exhibit the asymptotic behaviour of the covariation of the increments of the components of a multivariate Hawkes process, when the observations are imposed by a discrete scheme with mesh ∆ over [0,T] up to some further time shift $\tau$. The behaviour of this functional depends on the relative size of ∆ and $\tau$ with respect to T and enables to give a full account of the second-order structure. As an application, we develop our results in the context of financial statistics. We introduced in [17] a micro- scopic stochastic model for the variations of a multivariate financial asset, based on Hawkes processes and that is confined to live on a tick grid. We derive and characterise the exact macroscopic diffusion limit of this model and show in particular its ability to reproduce important empirical stylised fact such as the Epps effect and the lead-lag effect. Moreover, our approach enable to track these effects across scales in rigorous mathematical terms.},

abstract = {Network models with preferential attachment, where new nodes are injected into the network and form links with existing nodes proportional to their current connectivity, have been well studied for some time. Extensions have been introduced where nodes attach proportionally to arbitrary fitness functions. However, in these models, attaching to a node always increases the ability of that node to gain more links in the future. We study network growth where nodes attach proportionally to the clustering coefficients, or local densities of triangles, of existing nodes. Attaching to a node typically lowers its clustering coefficient, in contrast to preferential attachment or rich-get-richer models. This simple modification naturally leads to a variety of rich phenomena, including aging, non-Poissonian bursty dynamics, and community formation. This theoretical model shows that complex network structure can be generated without artificially imposing multiple dynamical mechanisms and may reveal potentially overlooked mechanisms present in complex systems.},

While current spreading models assume that users interact uniformly in time, following a Poisson process, a series of recent measurements indicates that the intercontact time distribution is heavy tailed, corresponding to a temporally inhomogeneous bursty contact process. Here we show that the non-Poisson nature of the contact dynamics results in prevalence decay times significantly larger than predicted by the standard Poisson process based models. Our predictions are in agreement with the detailed time resolved prevalence data of computer viruses, which, according to virus bulletins, show a decay time close to a year, in contrast with the 1 day decay predicted by the standard Poisson process based models.},

abstract = {Continuous Time Random Maxima are a generalization of classical extreme value theory: Instead of observing random events at regular intervals in time or with exponential distributed interarrival times, the waiting times between the events are also arbitrarily random variables. In case that the waiting times between the events have infinite mean, the limit process that appears differs from the limit process that appears in the classical case. With a continuous mapping approach we derive a limit theorem for the case that the waiting times are coupled to the subsequent events and for the case that the waiting times are coupled to the preceding events (in this case we speak of an Oracle Continuous Time Random Maxima, abbr. OCTRM). We get the distribution functions of the limit processes and a formula for a Laplace transform for the CTRM and the OCTRM limit. With this formula we have another way to calculate the distribution functions of the limit processes, namely by inversion of the Laplace transform and we get governing equations, which are in our case time fractional differential equations whose solutions are the distribution functions of our limit processes. Because of the inverse relationship between the CTRM and its first hitting time we get also the Laplace transform of the distribution function of the first hitting time.},

abstract = {This paper develops extreme value theory for random observations separated by random waiting times whose exceedence probability falls off like a power law. In the case where the waiting times between observations have an infinite mean, a limit theorem is established, where the limit is comprised of an extremal process whose time index is randomized according to the non-Markovian hitting time process for a stable subordinator. The resulting limit distributions are shown to be solutions of fractional differential equations, where the order of the fractional time derivative coincides with the power law index of the waiting time. The probability that the limit process remains below a threshold is also computed. For waiting times with finite mean but infinite variance, a two-scale argument yields a fundamentally different limit process. The resulting limit is an extremal process whose time index is randomized according to the first passage time of a positively skewed stable L??vy motion with positive drift. This two-scale limit provides a second-order correction to the usual limit behavior. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Inhomogeneous temporal processes, like those appearing in human communications, neuron spike trains, and seismic signals, consist of high-activity bursty intervals alternating with long low-activity periods. In recent studies such bursty behavior has been characterized by a fat-tailed inter-event time distribution, while temporal correlations were measured by the autocorrelation function. However, these characteristic functions are not capable to fully characterize temporally correlated heterogenous behavior. Here we show that the distribution of the number of events in a bursty period serves as a good indicator of the dependencies, leading to the universal observation of power-law distribution for a broad class of phenomena. We find that the correlations in these quite different systems can be commonly interpreted by memory effects and described by a simple phenomenological model, which displays temporal behavior qualitatively similar to that in real systems.},

abstract = {Despite their importance for urban planning, traffic forecasting and the spread of biological and mobile viruses, our understanding of the basic laws governing human motion remains limited owing to the lack of tools to monitor the time-resolved location of individuals. Here we study the trajectory of 100,000 anonymized mobile phone users whose position is tracked for a six-month period. We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing L{\'{e}}vy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent-based modelling.},

Considering the partial sum of the ?fist component and the corresponding maximum of the second component, we are interested in the limit distributions that can be obtained under an appropriate scaling. In the case that W_i and J_i are independent, the joint distribution of the sum and the maximum is the product measure of the limit distributions of the two components. But if we allow dependence between the two components, this dependence can still appear in the limit, and we need a new theory to describe the possible limit distributions. This is achieved via harmonic analysis on semigroups, which can be utilized to characterize the scaling limit distributions and describe their domains of attraction.},

We establish the asymptotic normality of our estimators for the two parameters appearing in our fPp model. This fact permits construction of the corresponding confidence intervals.

abstract = {We model the arrival of mid-price changes in the E-Mini S&P futures contract as a self-exciting Hawkes process. Using several estimation methods, we find that the Hawkes kernel is power-law with a decay exponent close to -1.15 at short times, less than approximately 10^3 seconds, and crosses over to a second power-law regime with a larger decay exponent of approximately -1.45 for longer times scales in the range [10^3, 10^6] seconds. More importantly, we find that the Hawkes kernel integrates to unity independently of the analysed period, from 1998 to 2011. This suggests that markets are and have always been close to criticality, challenging a recent study which indicates that reflexivity (endogeneity) has increased in recent years as a result of increased automation of trading.

 abstract = {The generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) is widely used to model extreme values, for example, exceedences over thresholds, in modeling floods. Existing methods for estimating parameters have theoretical or computational defects. An efficient new estimator is proposed, which is computationally easy, free from the problems observed in traditional approaches, and performs well compared with existing estimators. A numerical example involving heights of waves is used to illustrate the various methods and tests of fit are performed to compare them.},

 abstract = {Consider a sequence of possibly dependent random variables having the same marginal distribution F, whose tail 1-F is regularly varying at infinity with an unknown index $- \alpha < 0$ which is to be estimated. For i.i.d. data or for dependent sequences with the same marginal satisfying mixing conditions, it is well known that Hill's estimator is consistent for α-1 and asymptotically normally distributed. The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the central role played by the tail empirical process for the problem of consistency. This approach allows us to easily prove Hill's estimator is consistent for infinite order moving averages of independent random variables. Our method also suffices to prove that, for the case of an AR model, the unknown index can be estimated using the residuals generated by the estimation of the autoregressive parameters.},
